## *folklore | mirrorball*
>*"Mirrorball"* is the **sixth track** on Taylor Swift's 2020 album *Folklore*. The song discusses how Taylor Swift has many facades that the world sees and that she wants the world to see. However, as lovely as they are to look at, they are indeed very fragile.

# ***What is a mirrorball?***
>A'mirrorball,' like a disco ball, reflects light thrown at it, creating beautiful rays and patterns of light. The disco ball has thousands of tiny transparent material that emit a couple thousand beams of light. These objects, however, are really quite fragile, despite the fact that they bring a lot of joy to everyone around them.

## ***verse 1***
>Taylor Swift spits out information by referring to herself as a mirrorball or a disco ball. A disco ball in a club exists solely to enthrall the dancers. It will reflect a thousand light beams and emit a joyful vibration. Her status as a global superstar with a million fan base does not make her immune to her own fears and emotions. In reality, all of these walls could perhaps work as a vulnerability when they all crumble on to her.

## ***chorus***
>Taylor claims that she shines brightest when no one is looking. However, this could also refer to how a person starts to lose themselves in the dance.

## ***verse 2***
>Taylor Swift tells us in the second verse that the more shattered the mirrorball is, the more reflective it is. On a more personal level, she claims that she can change her personality to suit anyone. However, you stand the chance of twisting and bending yourself so much that it becomes irreversible.

>The party will not stop if the disco ball falls and crashes, no matter how much entertainment it provides. People on the dance floor will continue to dance despite their inebriation.

## ***bridge***
>She recognizes an entire "circus" act, the main purpose of which is to go to extraordinary lengths to entertain the crowds. A 'tightrope' is an excessive balancing act that we all perform, whether we are aware of it or not.
